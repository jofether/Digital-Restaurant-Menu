# Digital Restaurant Menu

A React application built with Vite that displays a restaurant menu using space-between alignment for dish names and prices.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Clean, modern layout
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Space-between alignment for menu items

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Build

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Rationale

This layout relies on Space-Between Alignment, often connecting an item on the left (Dish Name) with an item on the right (Price). It trains the model to detect horizontal separation in list items.
